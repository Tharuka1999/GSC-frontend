                While a love of wisdom is still important, today's Doctor of Philosophy applies to individuals who have pursued
                knowledge in a much more specialized field. Think of it this way: in the past, a philosopher was like a generalist scholar,
                broadly versed in many subjects. Today's PhD is a specialist who has delved deeply into a specific area of knowledge

            <p className="text-[16px] sm:text-[18px] font-catamaran mt-5">
                A PhD is a prestigious qualification recognized worldwide. Universities and higher education institutions award it to
                candidates who have completed a rigorous program. The core requirement? Extensive and original research in their
                chosen field, culminating in a thesis or dissertation. This thesis is essentially a lengthy document presenting the
                candidate's research question, methodology, findings, and contribution to the existing body of knowledge.

                Years of Dedication
            </h1>

            <p className="text-[16px] sm:text-[18px] font-catamaran mt-5">
                Traditionally, a PhD program is a significant time investment. It typically involves three to four years of full-time study,
                though it can take up to six years or more for part-time students. During this period, the student conducts their research,
                takes coursework, and eventually writes up their thesis or dissertation. This final document showcases their expertise and
                original contribution to their chosen field of study
            </p>

            <p className="text-[16px] sm:text-[18px] font-catamaran mt-5">
                In essence, a PhD is a journey of deep exploration and knowledge creation within a specialized field. It signifies not just
                extensive knowledge but also the ability to conduct independent research and make original contributions to a particular
                area of study.
